I do disagree the opinion. Although the technology bring many benefits to our life, improve the productivity, reduce the cost, it can't totally replace the traditional skills and ways of life. 

Because traditional skills is not only the old expertise, but also our  ancient wisdom,we have inspired idea from the old skills to create new thing. To the wide ocean of innovation, the tradition is more likely to be a source spring of the ocean. 

In the past decades, there are plenty of innovations always make our life more convenience and diversity. We are able to doing many things that we can't imagine before. But the way of simple life is still the first choice for the modern people.

Overall, new technology give us a second choice, but it doesn't mean it is a mandatory decision we have to make, we could let next generation know the history of skill by teaching them traditional skill, at the meantime, we could work in the modern world and live the traditional way.
