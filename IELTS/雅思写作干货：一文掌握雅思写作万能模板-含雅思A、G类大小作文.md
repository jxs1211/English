3) I strongly agree with the idea that the gender issue is only a determinant in the battle of the sexes, not the battles among nations and peoples.

# 三、A类图表小作文

A类小作文指南

雅思写作中的图表小作文是雅思A类考生的必考项目，相比于G类考生的书信小作文，A类图表小作文明显要有一些难度，关键考点在于：

1. **强调客观**。图表小作文强调客观描述、分析图表内容，即便是分析，也是做趋势性的客观分析，不是预测或者主观臆断，考生虽然图表小作文最后一段加注总结性陈述，也不会被扣分，但是如果总结跑偏则很容易扣分。
2. **突出重点。**图表数据呈现信息复杂，考生不要试图通过一篇小作文将各类数据描述的面面俱到，重点是突出图表的重点，如最高点、最低点、最大值、最小值、趋势走向等等
3. **语法词汇。**丰富的语法句型和词汇组合会使图表小作文增分不少，如对于趋势性的描述、对于从句的使用等等。
4. **段落结构。**建议A类小作文才用“1.引出话题”+“2.摘要概述”+“3.阐述细节”三结构的模式，至于“4.给出结论”考生可视情况发挥，其中阐述细节部分可以是多个自然段，但是不建议超过三个，一般两个段落为宜。详细段落结构参照雅思**[A类图表小作文分类及模板](https://www.ieltsday.com/go?_=629fef9c65aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pZWx0c2RheS5jb20vMTE2My5odG1s)。**
