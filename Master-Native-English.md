How do I decide to structure or orgornize it?
I have been working on sth. for a long time.
You should put things that you've learned in the course into the real world, and by doing that, the things that you learned are going to stick more. 
I think you are probably miss a lot of stuff, I recommand that you watch a video every or two everday. 
Don't rush into the course to allow youself to pracatice the course and view your notes.
That time to think is as important as learning stuff.
When your have some troubles, you could go away and think about it, what you did and what you could do it better. 
Then you will do it better next time. It's true for a lot of things.
After every course, you need some time to view your notes, to practice what you've learned, and using it in your daily life.
When it comes to learning language, recording what you've learned is really important.
pay very attention to sth.
I'd like you to make a commitment to be open minded.
The more you can be absurb, the more progress you can make.
It's about how to commmuicate with others.
And that's the main point of this, the skills and the knowledges you need to go out to the world, and use your skills to communicate with people.
This course will help you in many different areas improve your skills, knowledge, ability to communicate in English with pepole.
And without any more delay, let's go to the actual first lesson and I'd like to say that I hope you will enjoy this course.

#### 002 Overview and Key Vocabulary
- description
Description means being able to explain what something actually looks like or to give detail about something.
- phyical
Phyical thing is something that you can touch, something you can feel, something that you can look at.
When we describe something, we use colors, texture(is the surface of something), materials(what it's made of)
- nonphyical
Nonphyical think that something happen in our mind, like a dream, hopes, ideas.
- atmosphere: a general feeling of a place
When you go some place, you would like to say how a resturant feel, you could say this resturant has a really nice vibe here.
You can use vibe for people, for example, I get a very strange vibe of that guy.
We usually don't use atmosphere for people, for example, you are giving me a very strange atmosphere, not probably.
- cottage
It's a very small house, is often mode of stones, and it's often by a lake or water, usually.
- chimney
It's something that goes on top of the house, on the roof of the house, there is usually a fireplace under the chimney and smokes go through it, it is mode of stone.

#### 003 Basics of Description
I would like to describe something very clearly, and try to put it clearly in somebody's mind.
There is one thing you should keep mind, if we use one or two sentences to set all the basic details that we need at the begin of the description, I would recommend you use one sentence:
- 1 use one very clear sentence
- 2 more than one adj (and also can put three or four adjs in front of the n.)
We can put three or four adjs in front of the n. to make it really really clear for what we talk about and give the other person a very clear picture.
- 3 have a main noun
1998 can be used as an adj.

if you say a 32 pages book, all you doing there is hyphen, and you're making it into adj
adj can't be purals
so we're gonna use 3 adj here ,

For example, I have a yellow 4-door 1998 Ford with a good stereo. Now you will get a very clear picture about the car that I describe in your mind.
Then I can tell a story coz' you have a very clear picture in you mind, so the story will make sense.
